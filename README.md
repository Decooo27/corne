ZMK config and relevant files for my custom built split mechanical keyboard.

## Intro

My board is based on a popular split keyboard PCB shape called the `Corne`([github.com/crkbd](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd)), it features 3x6 column staggered keys and 3 thumb keys each. This means the use of layers is required to access all the keys of a normal board, but the advantage is that your fingers never need to leave the home row, resulting in faster and more comfortable typing. The keyboard being split also allows your arms to be placed more naturally on the table and prevents your wrists having to bend to meet in the middle. All these seemingly insignificant tweaks add up to a great improvement in ergonomics over the course of years spent typing.
