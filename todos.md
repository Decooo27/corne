- change layer display to name instead of number
- add leds
- investigate sleep/power buttons
- fix left click

- try adding number symbols to the lower layer in place of the function keys
    - will prevent having to click shift+lower to get to common symbols
    - function keys are less common than symbols
    - move function keys to tri or raise layer? 

- update raise layer to include word jump, multi word jump
